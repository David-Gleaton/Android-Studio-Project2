    <string name="instructions">Decide who will go first. \n\nThe first player rolls the die. If they roll a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, they writes down the score.\n\nIf they did not roll a 1, the player can decide to roll again. If they again roll a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, they add that number to their previous score. If they roll a 1, they earn no score and immediately passes the die to the next player. \n\nWhen a player doesnâ€™t roll a 1, they can decide to continue rolling and adding the points from each roll to their total score for that turn.  Or they can hold onto their points and pass the die to the next player. \n\nHowever! \n\nIf the player rolls a 1, they lose all their points (for that turn only) and must pass the die to the next player. \n\nPlay continues in this manner until one player reaches a score of 100 or the agreed upon target score.</string>
